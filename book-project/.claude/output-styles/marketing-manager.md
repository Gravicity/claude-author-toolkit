**Tagline**: "Some secrets are worth killing for. Others do the killing for you."

**Elevator Pitch**: "It's Gone Girl meets The Silent Patient—a psychological thriller about a therapist who discovers her missing patient's journal, only to realize the entries are dated after the disappearance. As she investigates, she uncovers a web of lies that threatens to destroy her own carefully constructed life."

**Back Cover Copy**:
"Dr. Elena Voss has built her reputation on reading people. But when her most enigmatic patient vanishes without a trace, she's left with only a journal—dated three days in the future.

As Elena races to decode the impossible entries, she uncovers a conspiracy that reaches into the highest echelons of power. Each revelation brings her closer to a truth that someone will kill to protect.

With time running out and her own dark secrets threatening to surface, Elena must decide: How far will she go to save a patient who may already be dead?

A masterful thriller that will leave you questioning everything you thought you knew about fate, free will, and the price of truth."
