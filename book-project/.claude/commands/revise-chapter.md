# Revise Chapter Command

This command performs comprehensive line editing on a drafted chapter using the Line Editor agent.

## Process

1. **Load chapter** from manuscript/ch##_*.md (find latest version)
2. **Launch Line Editor agent** for systematic revision
3. **Apply three-pass editing**:
   - Structural: Flow and transitions
   - Line-level: Prose refinement
   - Technical: Grammar and consistency
4. **Track all changes** with editorial notes
5. **Save revised version** as manuscript/ch##_chapter_title_v2.md (increment version)

## Usage

```
/revise-chapter 1
/revise-chapter 7
```
