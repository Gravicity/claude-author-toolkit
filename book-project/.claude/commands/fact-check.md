# Fact Check Command

This command performs comprehensive fact-checking on a chapter using the Researcher agent with web search capabilities.

## Process

1. **Load chapter** from manuscript/
2. **Launch Researcher agent** with web access
3. **Identify claims** requiring verification
4. **Search and verify** using multiple sources
5. **Insert markers** and citations
6. **Generate research report**
7. **Save annotated version**

## Usage

```
/fact-check 1
/fact-check 12
```

## Verification Scope

### Historical Accuracy
- Dates and timelines
- Historical events and figures
- Period-appropriate details
- Cultural and social contexts
- Technology and artifacts

### Technical Details
- Scientific facts and theories
- Medical and legal accuracy
- Geographic locations
- Procedural correctness
- Industry-specific terms

### Cultural Elements
- Languages and dialects
- Customs and traditions
- Food and clothing
- Architecture and design
- Social structures

## Annotation System

[DISPUTED: Historical accounts vary | Sources: Smith 2019, Jones 2020]
[ANACHRONISM: Zippers not invented until 1913]
[TECHNICAL: Medical procedure needs expert review]
```

## Research Standards

- **Minimum 2 sources** for standard facts
- **3+ sources** for controversial claims
- **Primary sources** preferred for historical events
- **Academic sources** for technical content
- **Expert validation** for specialized fields

## Output Files

## Citation Format

```markdown
[Source: Author Last, First. "Title." Publication, Date, URL/Page]
[Source: Organization. "Document Title." Date. URL. Accessed Date]
```

## Batch Processing

Fact-check all chapters:
```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
  claude "/fact-check $i"
done
```
